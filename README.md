##  Database:)

 Here I am using the API. Which fetch the all-contest data from all coding platform
and give it in the app. Now know somethings about the API: API stands for Application 
Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any 
software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service 
between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other 
using requests and responses.

## Future Scope of The Coding Contest App:

1) In future I can add many features in this app like, you are able to give contest by your 
mobile.


2) In future I can add some important question in this app for practicing, to the user.


3) In future I can make it more popular by the branding and many all-marketing stuff just 
because there is no any app like this for the competitive programmer who want to give 
contest by the mobile.


4) In future we want some price like if you are open daily this app than you can able to get 
goodies of our brand as well as some Boucher for the online course.


5) In future we can add our course video like if you are user than you can access our premium 
courses in some prices. So, like this I have many ideas for adding in my app and make it to 
brand.
